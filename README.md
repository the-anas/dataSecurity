# Data Security Project

This repository contains our Project for the Data Security Model. Since this project is divided into two parts. You can see two different folders in here. One addressing annotating privacy policies through text classification, the other addressing annotation through LLMs. 

You will find a seperate README.MD file in each folder with information about the code and instructions on how to run it.
