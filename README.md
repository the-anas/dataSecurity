## IMPORTANT NOTE

This repository contains our Project for the Data Security Model. Since this project is divided into two parts, you can see two different folders in here. One addresses annotating privacy policies through text classification, and the other addresses annotation through LLMs. 

You will find a separate README.MD file in each folder with information about the code and instructions on how to run it.
