## About Project
This repository contains our Project (Nicola and Anas) for the Data Security Module. Here we attempt to test and compare two different approaches to the automatic annotation of privacy policies: Text classification through fine tuning small transformer models and n-shot prompting with LLMs. 
Since this project is divided into two parts, you can see two different folders in here. 
Under `Text Classification/`, you will find files related to using transformers for text classification. You will find scripts we used for data transformation along with training scripts, training logs, and notebooks we used for testing various things.
Under `LLMs/`, you will find ...

You will find a separate README.MD file in each folder with information about the code and instructions on how to run it.
