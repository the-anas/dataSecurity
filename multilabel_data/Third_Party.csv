"To tailor advertising efforts. Most of the information and services available to you at Tulsaworld.com are free. In order to continue providing services free of charge, Tulsaworld.com sells advertising. Advertisers prefer to target their communication toward audiences who are most likely to be interested in their products. The information gathered on Tulsaworld.com helps us advise advertisers in general terms about certain aspects of site visitors (e.g. how visitors use the site, general demographic attributes of visitors, usage patterns on various parts of our site, etc.). This information helps both advertisers and Tulsaworld.com make better decisions about where to place advertising. This information may also be used to send targeted marketing, such as emails, to users that we think would be interested in such marketing. Visitors who choose to conduct financial transactions with advertisers on Tulsaworld.com may also provide specific data to those advertisers during the process of their transactions.

We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies with whom we have business relationships (""Affiliates"") and may share your information with service providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. For example, when you order a service, the third party payment processor we use releases your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service.
